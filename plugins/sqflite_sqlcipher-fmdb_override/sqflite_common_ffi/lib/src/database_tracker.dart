/// Users were running into database deadlocks after (stateless) hot restarts
/// in Flutter when they use transactions. The problem is that we don't have a
/// chance to call `sqlite3_close` before a Dart VM restart, the Dart object is
/// just gone without a trace. This means that we're leaking sqlite3 database
/// connections on restarts.
/// Even worse, those connections might have a lock on the database, for
/// instance if they just started a transaction.
///
/// Our solution is to store open sqlite3 database connections in an in-memory
/// sqlite database which can survive restarts! For now, we keep track of the
/// pointer of an sqlite3 database handle in that database.
/// At an early stage of their `main()` method, users can now use
/// `VmDatabase.closeExistingInstances()` to release those resources.
